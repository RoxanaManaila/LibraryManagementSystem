Library Management System is a C#, .NET Core and SQL project that I am still working on.
It represents an online library that allows the user to create an account, login/signup and reserve books and issue returns.
Up till this point, I have a completely functional loading screen, login/signup forms, as well as a menu that allows the user to navigate through the existing pages back and forth
and a logout button.
